			SerializationMethodForType, // type -> method
				// used to track:
				// type with [Serializable], keeps default ctor and special serialization ctor implied by ISerializable (without checking for ISerializable)
				// MarkType, any methods with On(De)Serializ(ed/ing)Attribute are kept.
			// if a type derives from EventSource, it's an eventsource implementation.
			// we keep all static fields on event source providers that are nested types of the implementation.
